title: "Poker Rule Induction"

The intent of this project is to learn poker rules by applying following 5 five learning algorithms:

- Decision trees with some form of pruning
- Neural networks
- Boosting
- Support Vector Machines
- k-nearest neighbors

This dataset is interesting becasue we need to predict the best hand you can play based on the cards you've been dealt without hand coding rules. The order of cards is also important, which means there are 480 possible Royal Flush hands instead of just four. Identify those, and the other 311,875,200 possible hands correctly. Pretend you  never played the game before, are given a history of thousands of games, and are asked to come up with the rules. It is potentially difficult to discover rules that can correctly classify poker hands. Algorithm will need to find rules that are general enough to be broadly useful, without being so broad that they end up being occasionally wrong.




# Data
Each record in this dataset consists of five playing cards and an attribute representing the poker hand. You are provided with 25,010 poker hands in train.csv and 1,000,000 in test.csv. Each hand consists of five cards with a given suit and rank, drawn from a standard deck of 52. Suits and ranks are represented as ordinal categories:

Each row in the training set has the accompanying class label for the poker hand it comprises. The hands are omitted from the test set and must be predicted by participants. Hands are classified into the following ordinal categories:

Attribute Information:

1) S1 "Suit of card #1" 
Ordinal (1-4) representing {Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs} 

2) C1 "Rank of card #1" 
Numerical (1-13) representing (Ace, 2, 3, ... , Queen, King) 

3) S2 "Suit of card #2" 
Ordinal (1-4) representing {Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs} 

4) C2 "Rank of card #2" 
Numerical (1-13) representing (Ace, 2, 3, ... , Queen, King) 

5) S3 "Suit of card #3" 
Ordinal (1-4) representing {Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs} 

6) C3 "Rank of card #3" 
Numerical (1-13) representing (Ace, 2, 3, ... , Queen, King) 

7) S4 "Suit of card #4" 
Ordinal (1-4) representing {Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs} 

8) C4 "Rank of card #4" 
Numerical (1-13) representing (Ace, 2, 3, ... , Queen, King) 

9) S5 "Suit of card #5" 
Ordinal (1-4) representing {Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs} 

10) C5 "Rank of card 5" 
Numerical (1-13) representing (Ace, 2, 3, ... , Queen, King) 

11) CLASS "Poker Hand" 
Ordinal (0-9) 

Class Information:

- 0: Nothing in hand; not a recognized poker hand 
- 1: One pair; one pair of equal ranks within five cards 
- 2: Two pairs; two pairs of equal ranks within five cards 
- 3: Three of a kind; three equal ranks within five cards 
- 4: Straight; five cards, sequentially ranked with no gaps 
- 5: Flush; five cards with the same suit 
- 6: Full house; pair + different rank three of a kind 
- 7: Four of a kind; four equal ranks within five cards 
- 8: Straight flush; straight + flush 
- 9: Royal flush; {Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten} + flush

#setwd("~/class/GTMachineLearning_Assignment_1/poker")

library(caret)
train = read.csv("train.csv")
test = read.csv("test.csv")
#Get rid of ID column
test = test[,2:11]

#Separate labels from training set
labels = as.factor(train$hand)
train = train[,1:10]

#Split training set into partial training set and validation set
part_train = train[1:18000,]
valid = train[-1:-18000,]

# Decision Trees
## decision tree algorithm
### bias-variance tradeoff
decision trees of depth D: increasing D decision trees of depth D: increasing D
typically increases variance and reduces typically increases variance and reduces
bias
Models that can fit the data very well have low Models that can fit the data very well have low
bias but high variance: bias but high variance:
“flexible flexible
” models such as models such as
nearest neighbor regression, regression trees nearest neighbor regression, regression trees

###  preference and restriction bias in each of the these algorithms
restriction bias  all possible trees
preference = inductive bias 
it pref good split at near the top. it pref correct ones to incoret ones. shorter tree to longer trees 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(rpart)
mycontrol = rpart.control(cp = 0.1, xval = 20)
fit = rpart(labels_part~.,method="class", data=part_train,control = mycontrol)
