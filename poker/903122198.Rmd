The intent of this project is to learn poker rules by applying following 5 five learning algorithms:

- Decision trees with some form of pruning
- Neural networks
- Boosting
- Support Vector Machines
- k-nearest neighbors

This dataset is interesting becasue we need to predict the best hand you can play based on the cards you've been dealt withoud hand coding rules. The order of cards is also important, which means there are 480 possible Royal Flush hands instead of just four. Identify those, and the other 311,875,200 possible hands correctly. Pretend you  never played the game before, are given a history of thousands of games, and are asked to come up with the rules. It is potentially difficult to discover rules that can correctly classify poker hands. Algorithm will need to find rules that are general enough to be broadly useful, without being so broad that they end up being occasionally wrong.




# Data
Each record in this dataset consists of five playing cards and an attribute representing the poker hand. You are provided with 25,010 poker hands in train.csv and 1,000,000 in test.csv. Each hand consists of five cards with a given suit and rank, drawn from a standard deck of 52. Suits and ranks are represented as ordinal categories:

Each row in the training set has the accompanying class label for the poker hand it comprises. The hands are omitted from the test set and must be predicted by participants. Hands are classified into the following ordinal categories:
